Every day, thousands of flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.
Customers who book these flights experience many interaction points with the brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business.
This task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present insights uncovered.
